When I first saw this question in a math chat group my intuitive is "That should be true!". However, the statment with only "continuous everywhere" is trivally false once you consider the notorious counterexample Cantor function. It is continuous, differentiable almost surely everywhere and derivative zero BUT NOT CONSTANT!  
Later I got to know that it is the exercise 7.21 from big rudin. I started to consider how everywhere differentiable but not only continuous makes a huge difference. 
Ideas are listed below:
 > Differentiablity gurantee that there is no "jump", Cantor function escapes by making a lot of small jumps to make the function continuous. For points in Cantor function, every point is approached by a discrete sequence (Since we know there is no "1" in the Ternay expression)
